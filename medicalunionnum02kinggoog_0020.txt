MEDICAL UNION NUMBER SIX

“You shall know,'' said Dr. O'Brien.
“Unions became a necessity lor the pre·
servation ol the masses as against the

classes. Their growth has beenanatural J

one, beginning first with the artisan class.
Having been carelully fostered under
the protection ol wise legislation, they
have now become the dominant force

' ol this Republic. As regards the Medi·

cal Union‚ we have a very complete
organization which comprises the entire
country.”

“Having been away, separated from
the world, so long,” said I, “the idea ol
a medical union seems strange to me.’'

“There was great opposition at first, '⁹ ,
said Dr. O’Brien. “People did not realize
that doctors had the same right to form
combinatione, unions or trusts, which
ever you wish to eall them, as had people
in other pursuits. While the majority .
have come to accept that principle now,
there are still some who would do away

with our union, but you will generally
find the ones most strongly opposed to
us are those who are prominent mem·
bers oi some other union or trust. The
American people are very patient; you
ean loist anything upon themis you
only go about it in the right way. ’¹
