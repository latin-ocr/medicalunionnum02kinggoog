MEDICAL UNION NUMBER SIX

was a severe experience‚ but Ι do not
now regret it.

Ι had thought much about the little

lellow Ι had seen dying of croup, and
also ol some changes which 1 considered
would be an improvement on the present
rulings ol the union. These changes 1

had not worked out in detail thoroughly
enough to present to the authorities who
could take action on them, but 1 had
given thern enough consideration to lead

me to suggest an idea or two to my col· ’

leagues one nightaswe' sat'around smok·
ing while waiting for calls. Ι noticed as
Ibegantotalk that my associates looked
queerly first at me, and then at one an-
other. Nevertheless, Ι proceeded to un·
fold some ol· my ideaS, pointing out just
how Ι believed the union could be im·
proved, as for instance by leaving many
things to the discretion ol the doctor on
hand, until the doctor to which the case
rightly belonged could get there. The
strange looks ol those near me changed
to fright, and as I continued still lurther
and ventured to suggest that the union
was altogether too hide-bound, every
one, to a man, sprang to his leet and
rushed out ol the room.
