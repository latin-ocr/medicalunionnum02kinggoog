MEDICAL UNION NUMBER slx

If you really want the strike declared off, ’
the first thing to be done by you is to
make an object, humble apology to us
for having presumedtoquestion the wis·
dom of unions. If that apology is satis·
factory to us, we will dictate terms. ”

The speaker hesitated fora moment,
and conferred with his associates, and
then, giving way, started in with the
apology.

“Stop‚” said I again. “Every mem·
ber of the committee must signify his
acquiescente in this apology.”

There was a brief hesitation, but in ⁴
less than thirty seconds every one joined
in supplication to us. The speaker evi·
dently had not expected to‘ be called
upon for an apology, and had not pre.-
pared himself, as he gave only a sort of
rambling talk, in which “we apologiae, ”
and “we are very sorry, ” 'occurred often.
After a little prompting by Dr. O'Brien,
which he took most meekly‚ assenting
to everything the riding delegate set
forth, the apology was finally concluded
in a satisfactory manner. Then Ι, as
chairmam propounded two questions:

“First, do you admit that this union
is a great blessing to humanity?”
