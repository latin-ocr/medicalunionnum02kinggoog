had a severe pain in the side of the chest
which was evidently due to a broken rib,
the broken end sticking into the pleura.
Of lar more threatening consequence,
however, was a crushed leg which was
beyond the power of surgery to save and
required arnputation at once. lbechest
surgeon‚ ol course, could not do this. As
considerable blood was oozing lrom the
mangled limb‚ I suggested that we
tighten the bandage which some one
had put around the groin to stop the
hemorrhage.

“No‚ no,''said the chest surgeon, “we
will telephone lor the extremity surgeon.
We have no right to touch that part.”

“But that may be necessary to save
the man's life‚’' 1 suggested.

“Perhaps'' said the chest surgeon,
· “but if tightening the bandage is the
only thing that will save his lile, so much
the worse for the man, as we cannot do
it. Every new man who eomes into the
union, especially if he be an old prac-
titioner, gets into trouble by interiering
with things that do not belong to him. 1
will set the broken rib, you prescribe an
opiate, and by that time the extremity

ssrgeon will be here ready to amputate
e limb. ’'
