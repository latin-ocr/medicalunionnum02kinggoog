MEDICAL UNION NUMBER SIX

“But 1 first need to do some study·
ing‚’' 1 replied. “While 1 have not ior-
gotten all I learned a third of a century
ago, Ι am not prepared again to prac-
tice without thoroughly reireshing my·
seli on what Ι did know, and learning
oi the advances which have been made
since 1 leit the profession ior adventure. '⁹

“Your fitness ior practice matters not
somuch,”said Dr. O'Brien. “Anhour's
coaching in the back room will prepare
you ior that, so iar as medical knowledge
isconcerned. Oi iar greater importance
is it ior you to properly school yoursell
inthe principles oi the union. That you
understand yourseli thoroughly as a
union man, and that you make no mis-
take in strictly following out the rules,
isavery important matter. Let me ask
you; will you unreservedly agree to obey
all the rules oi the urion, and abide by
the decisione ol the riding delegatesi”

“Il I amtakeninto the union‚” said 1,
‘¹1 shall feel in duty bound to obey its
mles, and, iurthennore, beggars cannot
beehoosers. However‚ having no know-
ledge ol your union, I should like to know
something ol its rules and workings be·
iore 1 unreservedly give assent. ''
