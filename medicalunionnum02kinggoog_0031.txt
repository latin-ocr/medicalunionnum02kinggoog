MEDICAL UNION NUMBER SlX

I listened to the reading of this docu-
ment with some surprise. However, I
had no compunction in signing it, as Ι
had been among the savages too long to
acknowledge allegiance to any country
or any God. 1 took note th'at the paper
did not ask the signer to go hungry, only
the family, and as Ι was not encumbered
with a family, Ι had no objection on that
score. Therefore, without comment, 1

took up the pen and signed, and sub·
scribed to thenath which followed.

“Do you know,'' said Dr. Tobias, “1
like your way of doing business;n0 ques-
tions, but simply sign. Such men make
a good, strong union. While some may
squirnr and talk about the prick of con-
science, and allegiance to their Maker,
and their country, they all have to sign
just the same, but we never feel so con·
fident of them, for that prick ol con-
science is apt to make itself felt once in
a while. Iam sure you and Ι will get
oniamously. For the present you are to
take Tour F our. The hours are from 12
midnight to 6 A. M, on diseases of the
chest. I believe Dr. O'Brien gave you
all the information required on that
subject.’'·
