MEDICAL UNION NUMBER SlX

irom him what cases 1 might be called to,
and also the treatment he was prescrib-
ing, that I might continue it to the best
of my ability. The doctor apologized
ior not leaving some work lor me. He
said he had not been informed that the
vacancy in Tour Four had been filled.
Consequently he had left word with all

the patients that they would be unable Ι ,

to get a doctor until after six in the
morning, as there would be no doctor on
duty for chest diseases until that hour.
He admitted that there were several who
should be seen, but the union would
not permit him to work overtime.
Neither would it permit other doctors to
see them, so he could do no more.
Having, therefore, nothing to do, I
lounged about the office, getting ac·
quainted with my associatos. I was
questioned much by my colleagues‚ as
they had all heard more or less of my
adventures. I was not averse to talking
of my travels‚ but I was more anxious

just at this time to leam my duties. I
looked to find a medical book or medical
journal from which I could glean some

infonnation, but Ι only found novels.
When I expressed surprise at this my
new friends laughed at me.
