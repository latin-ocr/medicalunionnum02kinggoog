Ol a crime; do you understand?”

“Νο, Ι do not,’' said 1. “Ol what

“You have not only been guilty ol a
crime, but you have been guilty ol the
greatest crime that can be committed

hold opinions ol your own, have dared
to think lor yoursell. That is a crime.
Worse than that, you have given utter-
ance to those opinions in the presence ol
union men. That is the greatestcrime!''

bers were allowed tohave opinions ol
their own, and give utterance to them?
