MEDICAL UNlON NUMBER SIX

When Dr. Tobiae entered his office 1
saw by the wrinkled brow, firm set jaw
and flashing eyes, that he was in an
angny mood, and 1 instinctively felt that
l was probably the cause of his dis-
pleasure. On that point he did not
leave me long in doubt. Taking his
seat, he eyed me sharply lor a moment.

“Dr. Schneider, '' said he stemly, “sit
down.'’ At the same time he empha-
sized his words by hitting the desk be-
fore him with the end of his lore-finger.
“1 do not know as you are so much to
blame as we are, or rather,asDr. O'Brien
is, lor taking such a man into the union.
1 protested at the time. Itold him that
you had been away from America too
long; that you had not grown up with
union sentiment, like those who had
been continuously in the country. But
he was determined to haye you, and I
was beginning to think his judgment
was right, alter all. Now comes this
blunder, this crime.-'’

“It appears lrom what l have heard
and seen,'’ said l, “that l have been
guilty ol some offense. Will you be so
kind as to let me know what that offense
' may be?''
